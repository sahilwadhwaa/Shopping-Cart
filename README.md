#Shopping Cart
##showcasing the usage of redux toolkit
(This project was made with the help of a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp. The course was conducted by John Smilga

As said for a gazillion times by me, this is a shopping cart consisting of mobile phones. The data for the cart is fetched from this API- https://course-api.com/react-useReducer-cart-project
Technologies Used- React, Redux Toolkit
Functionality-
We can Add more items in the bag, delete any items from the bag, and clear the cart altogether. 
The state of the React App is managed solely using Redux toolkit.
Async Thunk is also used to asynchronously fetch items from the API.

I'll add more summary points in the near future. Right now I just want to push this repo to Github.
